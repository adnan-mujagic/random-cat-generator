## Random Cat Generator
RCG is a script that randomly combines PNG files together in order to generate unique looking images. Currently working with cat pixel art!
![Sample Cat](https://github.com/adnan-mujagic/random-cat-generator/blob/mistress/images/skins/cat-1.png)
## Getting started
Navigate to a folder where you want to add this project,
Clone the repository with:
> git clone https://github.com/adnan-mujagic/random-cat-generator.git

Navigate to the root directory of the project.
From there, start the script by entering the following command in the terminal:
> node index.js

Watch the magic happen!
You should get a total of 60 unique images.

All the image layers were created by me using Photoshop, feel free to have fun with them and potentially add more layers/traits.

Good luck!
